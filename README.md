# Description:

### Welcome to NodeRun! A Developers best friend. The idea behind NodeRun is to decrease the amount of time we spend facing a wall in our code. Inspired by Yahoo Answers, and Stack OverFlow, NodeRun follows the same concept but with a twist i feel makes it unique & refreshed. Users post a snippet of their error, this places their error at the top of the Feed Page so that anyone visiting NodeRun will be able to see it & comment debugging solutions live. This saves you time surfing through decade old pages online with code that is outdated, and connects users to devleopers.
